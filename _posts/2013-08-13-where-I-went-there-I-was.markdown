Wherever I went, there I was. Whether it was at the banks of the Danube, the seats of the Colosseum, or on the steps of Westminster Abbey, I was still the same person I was thousands of miles away at home.

We are all dissatisfied with some aspect of our life – we might want a more fulfilling job, a crazier social life, or a better body. I was no different. I thought I could escape by jumping over to a few new continents over the span of a few months by myself. Surely, I would discover my essential self and become a whole new man, right?

And so I tried. Sure, every time I went to a new city, I could take on a new identity. I could be the hardcore partier in Amsterdam or the armchair philosopher in Prague. But these were only masks put on to everyone else, and whether or not they believed it did not matter. What mattered was that to me I knew that I was not that person. A few weeks on the road made me realize this. I had rid myself of a lot of problems by leaving my home, but those problems were only symptoms of a deeper sickness I had within myself. Travelling was a palliative, serving to only relieve the symptoms, but was not a cure. 

Zinn, a famed researcher into the modern concept of meditation, once said that “wherever you go, there  you there.” And that is what I felt. Wherever I went, there I was. I could run, but I could not hide from who I truly was. 

After a month of backpacking, I settled down in a different continent feeling different, but still not the person I wanted to be. I expected to be a different man, a wiser man, by the time I finished my journey, but I still felt like a boy. There seemed to be no conscious problems, but I could feel a deep unease with in myself that I did not know how to settle. 

And life began to take a more normal pace. I started programming again, starting some side projects. I made more permanent friends. I hit the gym. But everything felt weird. It was then I remembered how much I had enjoyed meditation before, and decided to start meditating again. Even after ten minutes, I realized how much of a difference it made for me. Now, I am not claiming that it turned me into an enlightened monk, but it changed something subtly. I remembered the individual joy of each breath, the sway of the flowers, and the joy of a simple hello with a stranger. 

So, why did I write this? The first part was to dissuade people from running away from their problems. I learned this through experience, but I understand that everyone needs to learn it their own way. I can surely say that after this journey, I understand that where I go, there I will be. I also wanted to spread the word of everyday mindfulness. It will only take up a few minutes of your time, but it can change everything. If you live in modern, Western society like I used to, then you might understand how fifteen minutes of mental silence can make mend a broken body.
